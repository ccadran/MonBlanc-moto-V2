# MonBlanc-moto-V2
A moto website with a mobile first approach.


I integrated a model that I found on Dribble to train my skills, this model was created by Dmitry Kiiashko and the moto design by Huigyu Kim.

I had some issue at the beginnig(as you can see in the MontBlanc-moto-V1 repository) who forced me to make a this project with a mobile-first approach but i succeed to overcome them by restart the project with this approach.
