# MonBlanc-moto-V2

I integrated a model that I found on Dribble to train my skills, this model was created by Dmitry Kiiashko and the moto design by Huigyu Kim.

I had some issue at the beginnig as you can see in the MontBlanc-moto-V1 repository but i succeed to overcome them by restart the project with the mobile version and redesigned the rest by started with it.
